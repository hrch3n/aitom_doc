# Cryo Electron Tomography

1. What is tomography?

   The word tomography is derived from Ancient Greek τόμος tomos, "slice, section" and γράφω graphō, "to write". A device used in tomography is called a tomograph, while the image produced is a tomogram. Tomography is imaging by sections or sectioning, through the use of any kind of penetrating wave.

2. What is cryo?
Cryo- is from Ancient Greek κρύος (krúos, “icy cold, chill, frost”).

3. What is Electron Cryotomography (CryoET)?
Electron cryotomography (CryoET) is an imaging technique used to produce high-resolution (~1-4 nm) three-dimensional views of samples, typically biological macromolecules and cells.

4. Why do we need Cryo-ET?

5. What is the output image from Cryo-ET?
